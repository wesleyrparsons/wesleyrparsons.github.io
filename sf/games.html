     <p>The <i>Elite</i> JV beat the Palm Beach PAL 4 to 3.
      Cotilla started and pitched a strong game, and Bobadilla closed.</p>
     <p>The <i>Elite</i> had to come back against an early PAL lead to win the game.
      In the fourth, Blechman, Valdes, and Billbrough singled in succession to get 2 runs.
      Next inning, the <i>Elite</i> put another on the board. Maggiore doubled, 
      Delacruz singled, and Prongay bunted Maggiore in.</p>
     <p>The <i>Elite</i> scored the go-ahead run in the sixth.
      Valdes walked and Nimer and Maggiore singled.  
      On an errant throw by the third baseman, Tarazona, running for Valdes, 
      charged home.  The PAL could not score in the bottom of the innning
      and the <i>Elite</i> won an exciting game.</p>
     <p>Pe&ntilde;a, Blechman, Billbrough, and Maggiore all had a 2-hit game.
      Parsons, Prongay, and Delacruz laid down successful sacrifice bunts.</p>

    <h5>Second Game: May 29, 2004</h5>
     <p>The <i>Elite</i> JV dropped a close game to the North Stars, 10 to 9.

     <p>The offensive highlight for the <i>Elite</i> was a homerun over the center field
      fence with one on by Delacruz.
      Blechman and Petersen had doubles, and lots of players singled.
      Defensively, Parsons made a diving catch in left field to save a run.</p>

    <h5>Third Game: May 30, 2004</h5>
     <p>The <i>Elite</i> JV beat the Collier County Select 6 to 5, 
      coming back in the last inning to win the game.
      Olson, Nimer, and McDonald pitched.</p>

      and fell behind by 3 runs.</p>
     <p>The <i>Elite</i> came alive in the last inning.  McDonald singled,
      Pe&ntilde;a walked, and Petersen doubled in a run, and Valdes knocked in another.  
      Two consecutive errors on throws to first allowed two more runs to score,
      giving the <i>Elite</i> a one run lead.</p>
     <p>Hingston set the Select down 1-2-3 in the bottom of the inning,
      and the <i>Elite</i> won their pool and advanced to semifinals.</p>

    <h5>Semifinal Game: May 31, 2004</h5>
     <p>The <i>Elite</i> JV beat their hosts, the Cape Coral
      Crusaders, 6 to 2.  After jumping out to an early lead,

      fourth run of the inning.</p>
     <p>The <i>Elite</i> put two more on the board in the fifth.
      Prongay was hit by a pitch, and Pe&ntilde;a put a fastball over the center
      field fence for a 2-run homer.</p>
     <p>On defense, Pe&ntilde;a made two diving catches in center field.
      and the <i>Elite</i> won their pool and advanced to semifinals.</p>
     <p>A tired <i>Elite</i> team moved on to their fifth game in 3 days in 90 degree
      heat against the Collier County Select, the local team they had defeated earlier.</p>

    <h5>Championship Game: May 31, 2004</h5>
     <p>An exhausted <i>Elite</i> team were soundly beaten by the Select, 8 to 0.

     <p>In the first inning, Delacruz doubled to start off the game,
      and was driven home by Parsons.
      The scoring continued in the second inning,
      when Petersen, Nimer, McDonald, Delacruz and Emory all walked,
      allowing 2 runs to score.
      One other run scored on a wild pitch.
      The control of the Storm&rsquo;s pitcher improved just in time

     <p>The <i>Elite</i> scored more in the fifth.
      Rivera and Prongay walked and Rivera took third.
      The <i>Elite</i> then executed a first-and-third play,
      with both runners safe.  
      Nimer then walked, and the <i>Elite</i> executed their second
      first-and-third play of the inning.  
      Prongay had the distinction of being both the distracting runner
      and the scoring runner in a first-and-third in the same inning.</p>
     <p>On the offense, Delacruz had two doubles.  
      Parsons picked up 3 RBI&rsquo;s.
      Nimer walked 3 times in a row and scored twice.</p>

      and fifth innings.
      In the second, Salmon and Petersen singled,

      With the bases loaded, Rivera tripled, scoring 3 runs.</p>
     <p>In the fifth, Delacruz took first after being hit by the pitch.
      Parsons singled, and Salmon singled in Delacruz.
      Petersen then doubled to score Parsons and Salmon.</p>
     <p>Emory shut down the Wildcats&rsquo; offense.
      They managed only 2 hits, both singles.
      Their run came off a walk, a stolen base,
      a questionable balk call, and a sacrifice bunt.</p>

    <h5>Fourth Game: Oct. 19, 2003</h5>

      Parsons drove them both in with a double,
      took third on the unsuccessful throw home, and
      scored on a passed ball.</p>
     <p>In the third, Salmon singled, 
      and Petersen tripled to deep center to score him.
      Maggiore singled to drive Petersen in.</p>
     <p>In the fourth, Delacruz singled and Parsons walked.
      Delacruz took third on an error,
      and came home on the throw to first
      after a dropped third strike.
      Petersen knocked Parsons home, 
      and scored himself when Maggiore singled.</p>
     <p>On defense, the <i>Elite</i> shut down a 
      Panther rally in the fifth when a leaping
      Nimer snagged a line drive at second, throwing
      to Emory for the double play.</p>
     
    <h3>Winter Haven Fall Twin Classic, Sept. 27-28, 2003</h3>
    <h5>First Game: Sept. 27, 2003</h5>
    <p>The <i>Elite</i> beat the Diamond Warriors, 4 to 3.
     Billbrough pitched 4 strong innings, and McDonald struck out two and

    <h5>Second Game: Sept. 27-28, 2003</h5>
    <p>The <i>Elite</i> beat Pasco County 6 to 5.  
     McDonald started, but Prongay took over in the second,
     and allowed 1 run in 4 innings of work.</p>
    <p>The <i>Elite</i> had to play catch-up when Pasco scored 4 in the first.
     They got some back in the bottom of the first.
     Delacruz, Nimer, Maggiore, and Rivera all singled to score 2 runs.

     by Delacruz.
    <p>The <i>Elite</i> put the game away in the fourth.
     Leading off, Parsons doubled, 
     followed by singles by Prongay and Maggiore.
     With Prongay on third and Maggiore on first, the <i>Elite</i>
     executed a perfect first-and-third play to score,
     giving them the lead.</p>
    <p>Maggiore had a 3-RBI night. Dees threw out two runners who thought
     they could steal second.</p>
    <p>The game started Saturday afternoon, but
     was delayed until the next day in the first inning with one <i>Elite</i>
     runner on first base.</p>

    <h5>Third Game: Sept. 28, 2003</h5>
    <p>The <i>Elite</i> were seeded number 3 out of 12 teams
     going into the play-offs.  They played and beat the number 2
     seed, the Oviedo Canes, 5 to 1, to advance to the championship game.
     Emory pitched a masterful complete game, giving up
     only a solo home run over the right field wall.</p>
    <p>The game was a scoreless tie until the bottom of the fourth,
     when the <i>Elite</i> came on strong.  
     Delacruz walked to lead off.  Parsons doubled in the gap in right
     to score one run, and took third on a  wild pitch.
     Prongay walked, and the rattled pitcher, with first and third occupied,
     balked to add another run.
     Prongay scored on a double by Rivera.</p>
     <p>The <i>Elite</i> followed up with insurance runs
     in the next two innings.
     Tarazona was hit by a pitch (for the third time that day),
     stole second, and went to third on a grounder by Dees.
     Delacruz lifted a sacrifice fly to center to score Dees.
     Next, Prongay doubled, and took third on a wild pitch.
     Maggiore sacrificed Prongay home.</p>
    <p>The <i>Elite</i> executed some defenses gems.
