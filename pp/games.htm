      In the second, Kacer singled, stole second, advanced to third on Maggiore's
      single, and was driven in by Anzivino.
      In the fourth, Parsons was hit by a pitch, stole second,

    <h3><b><center>Fifth Pascual Game June 18, 2001</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The Pythons dominated Latino America No. 2 in the top consolation
      bracket, winning 10 to 2 in four innings in a game shortened 
      by the 8-run knock-out rule.  
      Emory and Antonelli each went 2 innings on the mound.</p>
      <p>The Pythons hit well.  McDonald was 2 for 2, with a single, a double, and a walk.
      He has gone 7 for 7 in the last three games. 
      Parsons was 2 for 3, with a double, a triple, and 2 RBI.
      Martinez was 2 for 2, with a double and a single, and scored twice.
      Antonelli was 2 for 2 as well.</p>
      <p>The Pythons started scoring in the second inning and never looked back.
      McDonald doubled to lead off the inning.
      Shore showed bunt to draw the infield in, then slashed the ball past the pitcher's mound.
      Shore was safe at first, and McDonald moved to second.
      Antonelli singled to score McDonald.
      Welch laid down a beautiful bunt to move the runners up, and Cerda bunted again to
      score Shore.</p>
      <p>In the third, the first batter, Martinez, again doubled to lead off.
      Parsons tripled past the center fielder to score Martinez.
      Emory drove Parsons home with a hard grounder.</p>
      <p>The fourth was a big inning. 
      Antonelli singled.  Welch sacrificed him to third, and Antonelli took home on a throwing error.
      Cerda singled, and Lozano hit a long fly, which the right fielder dropped. 
      Martinez put down a squeeze bunt to send Cerda home. Lozano took second and third.
      Martinez stole second, advanced to third on a grounder by Maggiore, and stole home 
      off the understandably distracted pitcher.
      The Pythons were not done.  
      With the bases clear, Parsons doubled, and took third and home on wild pitches 
      (from a new pitcher).  Emory walked, stole second, went to third on one of the wild pitches, 
      and scored on an error by the second baseman.  
      At this point, the Pythons were ahead by 8 runs for a knock-out.</p>
      <p>On defense, Emory had 3 put-outs on 3 chances at shortstop.
      In the bottom of the fourth, with a runner on second, Welch caught a fly ball
      in center field, and dashed to second for an unassisted double play.</p>

    <h2><center>Memorial Day Weekend Disney Tournament 2001</center></h2>
    <h3><b><center>First Disney Game May 25, 2001</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The Pythons played their first game of the tournament 
      against the Massapequa Mets, winning 9 to 4.       
      Kraslow, Emory, and Anzivino combined for the win, 
      Kraslow going the first four innings, 
      followed by an inning of relief from Emory. 
      Anzivino struck out the last two batters to end the game.</p>
      <p>The Python's best at-bat came
      in the fourth inning, when they scored 5 runs.  
      Lozano led off the inning with a double, 
      and went to third on Cerda's sacrifice bunt.  
      Parsons doubled to score Lozano, and then stole third.  
      Emory tripled to score Parsons, and then scored on a passed ball.
      Maggiore and Kacer walked, then stole their way to second and third.
      McDonald grounded out to score Maggiore.  Welch singled in Kacer.</p>
      <p>Lozano and Maggiore had additional singles during the game, and Kraslow doubled.       
      All team members were awarded a game ball by the manager.</p>
      <p>The starting pitcher for the Mets had a high-velocity fastball, 
      but the Pythons were able to hit him (and he hit one Python).  
      The Long Island-based Mets seemed to have some trouble with the heat, 
      which rose to around 90 degrees toward the middle of the noon-time game.<p>

    <br>

    <h3><b><center>Second Disney Game May 26, 2001</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The Pythons lost 8 to 1 to a strong Tamiami team sponsored by Calypso Pools.
      This team went on to win the tournament.
      Emory started the game pitching, and had 6 strikeouts in 3 innings, 
      followed by Anzivino, who allowed only one run in three innings, 
      and was awarded a game ball.
      The team's hitting was sparse.  
      Parsons, Anzivino, and Shore singled, and Emory doubled.</p>
    </h3>
    <br>

    <h3><b><center>Third Disney Game May 26, 2001</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The Pythons lost a heartbreaker 7 to 6 in the final game 
      of the seeding series.
      A win would have sent them to the championship bracket.
      Their opponent was the Forest Park Cardinals, out of
      suburban Atlanta, a scrappy team that took chances on the bases.
      (And their parents and siblings knew some entertaining cheers.)</p>
      <p>Kraslow started the game as pitcher, and was relieved by Maggiore.
      The Pythons got their runs on walks and singles.  
      In the bottom half of the second inning, Lozano and Welch walked, 
      and Kraslow singled to score one run, 
      leaving runners on second and third.
      Parsons hit an infield chop that the third baseman could not handle 
      to score two more runs.
      The Pythons also scored once in the third on a single 
      by McDonald to drive in Kacer, who had walked.
      <p>In the fifth and last inning, the Pythons rallied to score two more runs, 
      but came up one run short.  Kacer walked, Antonelli singled, 
      and McDonald had an RBI on a grounder to the shortstop.
      Antonelli scored on a passed ball.  
      Anzivino then walked and stole second, 
      but the next two batters struck out to end the game.</p>
      <p>Cerda had his first hit of the tournament with a long single to right field.
      Defensively, the Pythons gunned down 4 Cardinals attempting to steal.<p>

    <br>

    <h3><b><center>Fourth Disney Game May 26, 2001</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The Pythons played their last game of the tournament against 
      the South Lake Eagles, a local team. 
      Anzivino started, and was relieved by Parsons and Kraslow.  
      Again, the game was a heartbreaker, 
      with the Pythons jumping out to an early 5-zip lead 
      but fading in the later innings, and losing 9 to 6.</p>
      <p>In the first inning, Emory singled, Maggiore walked, 
      and Kraslow singled to load the bases.  
      Antonelli then singled to drive in two runs.  
      Anzivino doubled to drive in two more runs, 
      and McDonald drove in Anzivino with a sharp single.  
      The Pythons scored one more run in the second when 
      Parsons doubled, stole third, and scored on a passed ball.  
      In the latter 3 innings, the Pythons had only one hit, 
      a single by Cerda.</p>

    <h2><center>Practice Games</center></h2>
    <h3><b><center>Practice Innings May 6, 2001</center></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The Pythons played two practice innings against the HPKL Midget II
      White Sox on May 5, 2001.  
      David Kraslow pitched both innings without giving up a run.  
      Kevin Kacer hit a triple to score two runs, and Brent Lozano knocked
      in another run.  The Pythons were ahead 3-0 
      when the game was called so the Sox could participate in the Home
      Run Derby and the Pythons could take a team picture.</p>
    </h3>
    <br>

    <h3><b><center>Practice Game May 12, 2001</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The Pythons played a practice game against the Miami
      Stingrays, a 12-and-under traveling team managed by Joe Perez, the Gulliver
      JV baseball coach, on May 12, 2001.  
      Sean Emory started on the mound and Michael Anzivino came in 
      after three innings, with Michael McDonald relieving.  
      Together they held the Stingrays to two runs.</p>
      <p>Kevin Parsons had 3 RBIs and went 3 for 4, including a triple, 
      and a double with the bases loaded.</p>  
      <p>The Pythons triumphed 6-2 after eight innings.</p>
      <p>The Stingrays have on their roster well-known HPKL players Vickash Ramjit, 
      Michael Mullane, and Trey Glasson (although Trey was not at the game).  
      The Rays played a good game despite missing several players.</p>
    </h3>
    <br>

    <h3><b><center>Practice Game May 19, 2001</center></p></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The Pythons again played the Miami Stingrays, 
      the 12-and-under traveling team managed by Joe Perez.
      The game was a slugfest, with the Pythons coming out on top 18 to 7.  
      Sean Emory, Kevin Parsons, and David Kraslow pitched for the Pythons.</p>
      <p>The Pythons hit well.  
      David McDonald had a triple and 2 singles to score 3 runs.
      Kevin Parsons went 3 for 4, including a double 
      and the team's first home run.  
      Sean Emory had 2 doubles to score 4 runs.
      Michael Welch had 2 singles and a double with 2 RBIs.  
      Michael Maggiore had 2 singles and 2 walks.
      Every Python who started made it to first base at some point during the game.</p>
      <p>The Rays have been joined by Luke Jones.  
      They played a tough game, 
      and had two productive innings at the plate.</p>
