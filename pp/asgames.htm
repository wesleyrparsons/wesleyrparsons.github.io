    <br>
    <h3><b><center>First All Star Game June 19, 2001</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The HPKL All Stars won their first game, 18 to 8, against the South Kendall
      All Stars at Perrine Khoury League Park.  Kraslow started, went 3 innings,
      and was relieved by Kacer, Parks, and Dieterle.</p>
      <p>The team hit well, and had two 7-run innings.
      Parsons was 3 for 4, with a double, and 3 RBI.
      Lozano was 3 for 4 with a double as well, and a sacrifice bunt, and had 2 RBI.
      Kacer had 2 singles, and 3 RBI.
      Maggiore had a single and a double with 2 RBI.
      Schalit and Jacquez both doubled, and Schalit had an RBI.
      Shore walked twice, and got an RBI on a sacrifice bunt.
      Dieterle, Glasson, Welch, Martinez, and Parks all singled.</p>
      <p>After falling behind 4 to 1,
      the HPKL All Stars broke out in the top of the fifth inning,
      Lozano singled to lead off the inning.
      Parks walked, and both runners advanced on steals.
      Lozano took home on a wild pitch.
      Maggiore hit a hard line drive down the left field line to
      score Parks, and then stole third.
      Parsons, Shore, and Kacer walked.
      Antonelli singled to score Maggiore; Parsons was out sliding into third.
      Shore took home on a passed ball.
      Welch bunted to send Kacer home and Antonelli to third, and was safe at first.
      Lozano doubled in Antonelli and Welch.</p>
      <p>The HPKL All Stars put the game away in the top of the sixth inning.
      Jacquez went to first after being hit in the back by a pitch.
      Dieterle walked to put runners at first and second.
      Parsons doubled to score both runners, and stole third base.
      Shore laid down a beautiful sacrifice bunt to score Parsons.</p>
      <p>The seventh inning was icing on the cake for the HPKL team.
      They scored 7 runs on six hits, two walks, and a sacrifice bunt.</p>
      <p>Defensively, lefty Parks picked a Kendall runner off first
      base in the sixth inning.  The runner was caught flat-footed at 
      Parks' move and made a half-hearted attempt to get back to base.  
      Maggiore and Schalit caught the game, and nailed two Kendall runners
      trying to steal in the third and sixth with throws to Parsons at second.
      Maggiore tagged a runner out trying to score in the second inning,
      and Schalit did the same in the fifth.</p>

    <h3><b><center>Second All Star Game June 24, 2001 (Morning)</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The HPKL All Stars lost their second game, 7 to 4, to a 
      strong Perrine Midget team that featured two ex-HPKL players batting
      third and fourth and pitching.  
      Parks started, and was relieved by Ramjit and Kraslow.</p>
      <p>The team got all its runs in a big third inning.
      Martinez started off with a single, and Parks walked.
      Ramjit followed with a single to load the bases for Parsons.
      Parsons singled to right to drive in two runs, and the runners 
      advanced to second and third on the throw home.  
      Jacquez hit a hard grounder to score Ramjit and advance Parsons to third.
      Dieterle drove in Parsons for the fourth run.</p>
      <p>On defense, the All Stars executed a 6-4-3 double play in the 
      seventh inning.  The batter hit a sharp grounder to Lozano at short,
      who flipped to Parsons at second, who drilled the ball to 
      Dieterle at first to end the inning.</p>
      <p>Parks once again picked a runner off first base in the second inning.  
      No runner has yet been able to figure out his move to first.</p>

    <h3><b><center>Third All Star Game June 24, 2001 (Evening)</center></b></h3><br>
    <h3><p>The HPKL All Stars played a second time the same day, 
      in a game delayed by thunderstorms.
      The team lost, 12 to 9, to the Kendall South team they had beaten earlier.
      Kraslow started and was relieved by Ramjit and Parks.</p>
      <p>The team scored in four of the nine innings, but did not have a big inning.
      Maggiore had a triple to the wall in left field.
      Parsons was 5 for 6, with 3 RBI and 2 doubles.
      Lozano had 2 singles and 2 RBI.
      Dieterle singled to drive in 2 runs.
      Ramjit singled twice and had an RBI.
      Parks got on base 2 out of 3 at-bats, and scored a run.
      Glasson and Jacquez singled.</p>
      <p>The defense made two noteworthy plays.  
      In the fourth inning, the batter doubled and took second on a grounder.  
      He strayed too far off third base, and Schalit, catching, threw to Dieterle at third,
      and got the runner in a run-down.  After three throws, 
      Schalit tagged the runner out at home.
      In the fifth inning, another runner thought he'd take a big lead off second.
      Maggiore at catcher threw to Parsons at second to catch the runner off the bag.
      The runner bolted for third, and Dietere made the tag out.</p>
